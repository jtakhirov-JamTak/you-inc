// You, Inc. — price engine scoring config (SINGLE SOURCE OF SCORING CONSTANTS).
//
// Every number the price engine uses lives here. The values are UNVALIDATED and
// will be tuned after the concierge test — tuning is an edit to this file, never a
// refactor of the engine. Bump SCORING_VERSION whenever the settlement OUTPUT or
// ALGORITHM changes — a tuned value HERE, or a formula/gating change in the engine
// (engine.ts / weeks.ts / settlement.ts) — so each derived ledger row stays
// attributable to the exact rules that produced it. The version stamps the
// algorithm, not just this file.
//
// Source of truth: docs/you-inc-spec.md + the founder's scoring table.
//
// Two denominators (enforced by the engine, not here):
//   • habits / streak / recovery / collapse  → % of the FIXED $200,000 baseline.
//   • sprint payoffs                          → % of balance_at_set_time (frozen).

// v2 (2026-06-20): weekly = cap/full-week-target (was cap/occurrences-so-far);
// mid-week habits score pro-rata (were excluded); partial weeks frozen out of the
// streak/collapse layer. v1 produced no settled rows in production.
// v3 (2026-06-29): new 4-position roster (1 morning + 1 evening + 1 mission, all
// per-day "daily" role; 1 vice). The weekly cadence/role and its per-occurrence
// scoring are gone; streak categories collapse to ['vices','daily']; vices-collapse
// now needs the single vice (was both of two). Ledger wiped at the same change, so
// no v2 rows survive to reconcile.
// v4 (2026-06-29): the DAILY streak/recovery bonus scales by how many of the 3 asset
// slots are active (×assets/3: 1→⅓, 2→⅔, 3→full), and a vice collapse (the vice
// slipped every day) applies a 50% haircut to all streak/recovery bonuses that week.
// Empty-roster weeks no longer book $0 rows. Ledger empty at the bump (clean cutover).

// the just-closed week's logs (forgot to log, travel, sickness, late entry) before
// the score for that week locks. With 1, a week that ends Sunday settles at the
// user's local midnight ending Monday (i.e. Tuesday 00:00 local). The grace day's
// logs remain editable; the new week runs live alongside it (Home shows last week
